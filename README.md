# Leaf Image-Based Plant Diseases Classification using Deep Transfer Learning
As an agricultural country, Bangladesh’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) heavily relies on the health and productivity of its plants and crops. However, every year, farmers incur significant losses due to various plant diseases, particularly those affecting plant leaves that can spread rapidly and cause widespread damage. Consequently, it is of utmost importance to accurately and promptly identify plant diseases to prevent the destruction of large quantities of crops. Effective disease identification can help mitigate losses, enhance agricultural productivity, and support the economic stability of the country. This study investigates the application of deep transfer learning for the classification of plant disease based on leaf images. Utilizing the PlantVillage dataset, which comprises 20,639 images encompassing three crop species and twelve distinct diseases, we aim to develop a robust and accurate classification model. In our approach, multiple deep learning models—ResNet50, Xception, EfficientNet-B1, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121 were employed to classify plant leaf diseases. Through comprehensive experimentation and performance evaluation, EfficientNet-B1 emerged as the most effective model, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 98.5%. This study advances the subject of precision farming by providing an efficient tool for early disease detection, which is crucial for crop management and yield optimization.
